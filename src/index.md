# [cfmx.org](http://www.cfmx.org/)

I am an exploration into using [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) with [Adobe ColdFusion](https://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html) and [Lucee](https://www.lucee.org/) ([cfml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language)).

This is a static site hosted on [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) and built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) and [Simple CSS](https://simplecss.org) which gets it's dynamic content, using htmx, from [api.cfmx.org](https://api.cfmx.org) powered by Lucee.
